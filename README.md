# Silly-Guessing-Game

### What it does?
The page will prompt you to guess a number between 0 and 10. As you guess it gives you hints to get you closer to the answer.

Once you have guessed the answer it thinks of a new number. This goes on and on and on forever until you stop playing.

It's just a simple silly game I did as a quick coding exercise. On the plus side, my kids liked it for a few minutes.

### Adjusting it
You can easily change the range of numbers by
1. Updating the H1 on line 11 of guess.html.
2. Updating lines 1, 2, and 13 in guess.js.
